- **Project Overview**  
  Meowgic Catch is a **3D grid-based game** where you control a cat made from simple shapes. You’ll collect fish, dodge enemy dogs, and leverage time-limited boosts. The environment evolves as you play—**sky cycles** and **random weather** change how you move and plan.

- **Objective**  
  **Collect as many fish as possible** while staying alive. Use movement, jumps, combos, decoys, and meows to evade dogs, intercept stolen fish, and maximize your score before your lives run out.
